== Overview
The Design Sub-Team is responsible for the CAD/CAM designs used to build the robot.  In order to make good designs it is necessary to understand the manufacturing and mechanical sub-team's jobs very well.  It is quite challenging to make a design that is easy to manufacture, easy to assemble, and easy to maintain.

NOTE: The design process is an iterative process.  Designs evolve and change during robot building and testing.

We use Autodesk Fusion 360 as our design software.  Each season we create a new Project that is used for all of the design files.  It is important to keep the project directory organized with folders that contain the components for each logical sub-component of the robot (i.e. frame base, drivetrain, arm, intake, turret, etc.).  There should also be a `Vendor` folder that contains all of the downloaded 3D models from the various vendors we use for Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) items.

== Fusion 360

=== Learning Fusion

Try to learn as much as you can in order to efficiently and effectively use Fusion 360.  This means practice by doing some examples, watch the tutorial videos from Autodesk, and ask questions when you are struggling.

Watch the https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/courses/[Fusion 360 Tutorials] in particular the [.underline]_Sketch basics_, [.underline]_Solid modeling basics_, [.underline]_Introduction to 3D modeling_, and [.underline]_Advanced part modeling techniques_ from the *3D modeling* series.

Watch the video https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/100-Things-Beginners-Should-Learn-Fusion-360-2020[100 Things Beginners Should Learn].

https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/components-vs-bodies-tips-fusion-360/[7 Tips for Organizing Bodies & Components] discusses the key idea of activating a component before doing any operations on the component to make the timeline cleaner and better organized.

Also checkout the https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog#getting-started[Fusion 360 Blog] for other tips and tricks.

=== Sketches are Key

Sketches are the most important part of Fusion to master when you are just learning.  In particular the efficient use of constraints and dimensions will help make designs easier to modify in the future.

IMPORTANT: ALL SKETCHES MUST BE FULLY CONSTRAINED.  No exceptions.  DO NOT USE THE LOCK CONSTRAINT. 

Fully constrained sketches force you to consider all aspects of the geometry of the sketch and make modifying the sketch later much easier.  

Use construction lines when necessary.  They are sometimes easier than using dimensions for overall positioning.  When a part must mate with another, project only the geometry necessary to align the two parts.

=== Sketch Exercise {counter:tasknum}

|===
a| `*Exercise {tasknum}*` 
a| Design a plate 4in x 2.5in x 0.25in with the mounting hole pattern for a RevRobotics NEO motor in the center.  Use a close fit clearance hole size for the motor mount bolts (see <<fasteners>> and https://littlemachineshop.com/reference/tapdrill.php[Drill/Tap/Clearance Hole Chart]).

a| QUESTIONS: ::
. Is your sketch completely constrained (no blue lines)? Do NOT use locking.
. Would this hole pattern work for a Falcon 500 motor?  If not, what changes would have to be made to be able to use either a NEO or a Falcon?

== Using Vendor 3D Models

Most all of the robotics parts vendors provide 3D models (STEP files) of their products that can be easily used in a design.  In addition Fusion 360 makes it very easy to add fasteners from McMaster-Carr into a design.  It is easiest to put all the robotics vendors 3D models into a common folder (`Vendor`) so each design doesn't need to import their own copy.

== Drive System Design

Belts, Chains, and Gears are commonly used on FRC robots.  When a design uses these elements it is possible to choose the distance between rotation centers such that exact lengths of belts or chains work correctly.  Gears will not work without precise center-to-center distances. 

=== Belt Drive

Belt drive systems are a quiet and relatively safe means of transferring rotation between shafts.  FRC belts are either 5mm HTD belts or 3mm GT2 belts, where the distance represents the pitch of the belt teeth.  They also come in either 9mm or 15mm widths. Belt pulleys don't come in as many tooth count options as chain sprockets or gears which limits the gear ratios available.

The center-to-center distance for a belt system can be calculated with the https://www.reca.lc/belts[ReCalc Belt Calculator] or with the https://wcproducts.com/pages/calculator-belt[WCP Belt Calculator].

=== Chain Drive

Chain used in FRC comes in a smaller size (#25) and a larger size (#35).  Chain drives are strong but noisy and dangerous (can cut off fingers easily).  Chain sprockets come is a fairly good range of sizes with the larger sprockets having a VersaHub bolt pattern rather than a 1/2" Hex bore.  Chains have a tendancy to stretch and loosen slightly over time.  ReCalc has a https://www.reca.lc/chains[Chain Length Calculator].

=== Gear Drive

Gears come in many tooth counts (every 2 tooth increments) and the larger sizes are 1/2" Hex bore (unlike chain sprockets).  The center-to-center distance can be found with the https://wcproducts.com/pages/calculator-gear[WCP Gear Calculator].  

Once a center-to-center distance is found for a pair of gears, any gears that sum to the same tooth count will work for that center-to-center distance.  For example if you find the center-to-center distance for a 16T gear meshing with a 44T gear then you can take the sum of the tooth counts (16T + 44T = 60T).  Now any pair of gears that sum to 60T will work with that center-to-center distance (e.g. 24T and 36T).  In the technical drawing for the  https://wcproducts.info/files/frc/drawings/Web-WCP-0225.PDF[WCP Rotaiton SS Gearbox] you can see that this sum is specified for each stage of the gearbox.

== Fasteners

FRC robots usually use either socket head cap screws or button head screws due to their strength and ease of use.  Socket head cap screws are the strongest type of screw.  Button head screws have a lower and wider head and are good when holding thin sheet metal or when the lower profile is needed.
