== The Team 4698 Test Bench

The Test Bench was created to allow students wanting to learn FRC robot programming a way to do example problems without needing access to a functioning robot.  As you read these examples they will refer to terms and/or concepts that will not be familiar to you.  Stop and lookup what these unfamiliar terms/concepts mean as you go along.  

The Test Bench uses a {hw-roborio} and a {hw-PDP}.  It has two motors attached to it, a brushed motor {hw-neverest} and a brushless motor (a {hw-neo550}) connected to two different motor controllers (a {hw-spark} and a {hw-sparkmax}).  The {hw-spark} motor controller is controlled with PWM and the {hw-sparkmax} is controlled over the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus[CAN bus] of the {hw-roborio}. 

The NeveRest motor connected to the large disc is used in the position control exercises and refered to as the "Position Control" motor. It is connected to the {hw-spark} motor controller which is wired into the {hw-roborio} PWM channel {pos-motor-pwm}.  The position control motor has a {hw-srxmag} attached to its output shaft.  The SRX is wired into the {hw-roborio} DIO channels {pos-motor-quadA}, {pos-motor-quadB}, and {pos-motor-abs}. Channels {pos-motor-quadA} & {pos-motor-quadB} are the Quadrature A and B inputs and channel {pos-motor-abs} is the absolute PWM signal.

The {hw-neo550} motor that is mounted on the short bracket is used in the velocity control exercises and refered to as the "Velocity Control" motor. It is connected to the {hw-sparkmax} motor controller which is connected to the {hw-roborio} CAN bus with ID {spark-max-canID}.  The {hw-neo550} has a built-in encoder.

The Test Bench does not have a WiFi radio so the coding computer must be connected to the {hw-roborio} with a USB cable (USB A to USB B).  The Test Bench must also be powered by a robot battery.

== Simple Motor Percent Output
:tasknum: 0

In this example we will be creating a "Timed Robot" program to set the position motor's percent output based on the position of a controller joystick.

Launch "WPILib VS Code" from the desktop.  This runs VS Code with the WPILib libraries and tools enabled. https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/creating-robot-program.html[Follow these directions to create a blank project from the "Timed Skeleton (Advanced)" template].

You should now have an empty project.  The two files that we will be working with are `src/main/include/Robot.h` and `src/main/cpp/Robot.cpp`.  Find those files in the Explorer on the left sidebar of VS Code and open `Robot.h`.  It contains the `Robot` class which declares (See https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/forward-declarations/[Forward Declarations and Definitions]) the `Robot-`, `Autonomous-`, `Teleop-`, `Disabled-`, `Test-`, and `Simulation-` Init() and Periodic() functions.

#pragma once

#include <frc/TimedRobot.h>

class Robot : public frc::TimedRobot {
 public:
  void RobotInit() override;
  void RobotPeriodic() override;

  void AutonomousInit() override;
  void AutonomousPeriodic() override;

  void TeleopInit() override;
  void TeleopPeriodic() override;

  void DisabledInit() override;
  void DisabledPeriodic() override;

  void TestInit() override;
  void TestPeriodic() override;

  void SimulationInit() override;
  void SimulationPeriodic() override;
};
----

For this simple example we won't need most of the Init() and Periodic() functions so delete all the declared functions except `RobotInit()`, `RobotPeriodic()` and `TeleopPeriodic()`.  `RobotInit()` runs once when the code first starts, `RobotPeriodic()` runs every 20 milliseconds at all times, and `TeleopPeriodic()` runs every 20 milliseconds while the Driver Station is in `TeleOperated` Mode.

We need to add member variables to the `Robot` class for our motor controller and for a joystick.  The motor controller on the position motor is a {hw-spark} controller so we will be using the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_spark.html[`frc::Spark`] class.  Open the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_spark.html[`frc::Spark`] class API documentation which will show what methods are available with the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_spark.html[`frc::Spark`] class and what header needs to be included to use the class.  In the API documentation for https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_spark.html[`frc::Spark`] only the constructor that takes the PWM channel is shown along with the default constructor and the assignment operator.  Expand the `Public Member Functions inherited from frc::PWMMotorController` section to see more member functions that are available that are inherited from the `frc::PWMMotorController` class which is a base class of https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_spark.html[`frc::Spark`] (See xref:CPP_Lessons.adoc#object-orientation[Object Orientation]).  In `Robot.h` add a private section to the `Robot` class that declares a https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_spark.html[`frc::Spark`] variable and initialized the channel to one. Also add a https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_xbox_controller.html[`frc::XboxController`] variable initialized to port zero. Add the two headers that are needed for the new classes.

The `src/main/cpp/Robot.cpp` file has the definitions of the Init() and Periodic() functions for the `Robot` class. Remove all the Init() and Periodic() functions except `RobotInit()`, `RobotPeriodic()`, and `TeleopPeriodic()`.  Now add the line shown below to `TeleopPeriodic()` which sets the motor percent output (-1 to 1 value) to the value of the X-axis on the controller.  You won't use `RobotInit()` and `RobotPeriodic()` just yet.

----

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Build the project with the above changes added and make sure there are no errors.  Then connect to the test bench with a USB cable and power the test bench. Connect an Xbox controller or a Logitech controller to the your laptop and run the Driver Station.  Now deploy the code to the {hw-roborio}.  Select `TeleOperated` on the driver station and press `Enable`.  The left joystick's x-axis motion should now control the speed of the motor.
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. What other Xbox Controller controls could be used to move the motor? 
. What is the difference between a controller "button" and an "axis"?  
. How many axes are on an Xbox Controller?
. How would you change the code to use the PS4 Controller?
|===

=== Adding an Encoder

We are going to add the built-in encoder to our program so we can see how much the motor has turned and how fast it is turning.  In `Robot.h`, use the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_encoder.html[`frc::Encoder`] class to declare a variable for the encoder on channels {pos-motor-quadA} and {pos-motor-quadB}.

.Changes to Robot.h
[source,C++,subs="attributes"]
----
  // Add the following header:
#include <frc/Encoder.h>

... 

    // Add a private member variable such as:
  frc::Encoder m_enc{ {pos-motor-quadA}, {pos-motor-quadB} };
----

=== Visualizing What is Happening

The `Shuffleboard` program is used to communicate with the {hw-roborio}.  The {hw-roborio} can send information to `Shuffleboard` and `Shuffleboard` can be used to send information to the {hw-roborio}.  The https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_smart_dashboard.html[`frc::SmartDashboard`] class is one method to communicate with `Shuffleboard`.  We will use the *static* member functions of the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_smart_dashboard.html[`frc::SmartDashboard`] class to add information about the motor and the joystick position to `Shuffleboard`. 

|===
| *{CPP}* classes with *static* member functions are used like regular functions. You do not create instances of the class. See https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/static-member-functions/[Static Member Functions]
|===

Modify `Robot.cpp` to the following:

[source,C++]
----
#include "Robot.h"
#include <frc/smartdashboard/SmartDashboard.h>

void Robot::RobotInit() {
  frc::SmartDashboard::PutData( "Velocity Motor", &m_motor );
  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber( "Encoder Distance", 0.0 );
  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber( "Joystick X-axis", 0.0 );
}

void Robot::RobotPeriodic() {
    // Get the current encoder distance and send it to the
    // SmartDashboard.
  double enc_dist = m_enc.GetDistance();
  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber( "Encoder Distance", enc_dist );
}

void Robot::TeleopPeriodic() {
    // Get the controller Left stick X-axis value
  double x_axis = m_controller.GetLeftX();

    // Send the value to the SmartDashboard
   frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber( "Joystick X-axis", x_axis );

    // Set the motor percent output to the controller x-axis value
  m_motor.Set( x_axis );
}

#ifndef RUNNING_FRC_TESTS
int main() {
  return frc::StartRobot<Robot>();
}
#endif
----


|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Compile and deploy the code to the test bench.  Run Shuffleboard and select the "SmartDashboard" tab.  Move the motor disc by hand and observe the encoder value changing.  Now select `TeleOperated` in the Driver Station and `Enable` the {hw-roborio}.  As you move the joystick, `Shuffleboard` will display the joystick output, the motor percent output (which should be the same), and the encoder distance.
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. How much does the encoder distance value change for one rotation of the disc? 
|===

=== Encoder Values

The encoder values displayed on Shuffleboard are obtained with the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_encoder.html[`frc::Encoder`] `GetDistance()` function. By default, encoders return distance in raw "counts" which can vary between a few counts per revolution up to 4096 or more depending on the resolution of the encoder.  Approximate how many "counts" the encoder has per revolution by rotating the disc one full revolution (with the joystick) and determining the change in the distance measurement.  For this motor the number of "counts" per revolution should come out to be 1024.

When programming the robot we want to work with more meaningful units than raw counts.  If the mechanism is an arm that will move less than a full revolution then we probably want to use degrees.  If the mechanism is a spinning flywheel then we probably want to use revolutions. The https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_encoder.html[`frc::Encoder`] class has a member function called `SetDistancePerPulse()` which allows you to change the units returned by the `GetDistance()` function.  

Make the following modifications to the `RobotInit()` function to make the encoder return distance in rotations:

.Changing Encoder Units
[source,C++]
----
    // Add SetDistancePerPulse() function call to RobotInit()
    // Converts a 1024 count per revolution encoder to read rotations
  m_enc.SetDistancePerPulse( 1.0 / 1024 );
----

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Deploy and run the robot code with the `SetDistancePerPulse()` function call added and note the units displayed in Shuffleboard which should now be rotations. 
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. How would you modify the code so the encoder returned distance in degrees?
. What units would be most useful for a drive base motor?
|===

== Position Control Exercise
:tasknum: 0

The Percent Output exercise (<<simple-motor-percent-output>>) above is the most simplistic way of controlling a motor.  Percent output control cannot perform the kinds of control that are needed for almost all robotic systems.  This project will move a motor to a specified position and hold it there.  It will use P-control (position-control) to maintain the desired position which is a *feedback* control algorithm.

If you haven't already, read the xref:README.adoc#motion-control[Motion Control] section and watch the "PID Video, Part 1" in the first part of that section.  This example builds on the project that was created in <<simple-motor-percent-output>> so you will need the code from that project. If you have used the `SetDistancePerPulse()` function as outlined in <<encoder-values>> then comment out the function call so that the encoder reads "counts".

=== P-Controller

The video in the first part of the xref:README.adoc#motion-control[Motion Control] section does a good job of describing what a P-controller does but I will reiterate it here.  The idea is to measure the current position of the robot mechanism (*y*) and then take the difference between the desired position (*r*) and the current position (*y*), this is the current position error (*e*).  We then set the motor percent output to the error (*e*) multiplied by a constant (*K~p~*) to scale things correctly.

[.text-center]
****
Motor Output = *K~p~* * *e* = *K~p~* * ( *r* - *y* )
****

Add code to hold the position 0 while the *A* Button is held down and then move to the position 500 when the *B* button is held down.  When neither button is held then it should just stop the motor. The pseudocode for this is expressed as:

.Pseudocode for P-Controller
[subs=normal]
----
    If *Button A* is held::
      error = 0 - {encoder position}
      set motor output to (K~p~ * error)
    Else If *Button B* is held::
      error = 500 - {encoder position}
      set motor output to (K~p~ * error)
    Else
      set motor output to zero
    End If
----

This logic will go in the `TeleopPeriodic()` method. A good starting value for *K~p~* is to take the total distance that the motor has to move from one setpoint to the other (500 in this case) and take the inverse of that number ( 1.0 / 500 ).  So as a first guess, the value of *K~p~* should be 0.002. 

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Implement the above pseudocode for the P-controller. Change the value of the *K~p~* constant and observe the difference in behavior of the mechanism. Note whether the actual position gets exactly to the desired position (setpoint).
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. What happens when K~p~ is too small? too large?
. What is the difference between the `GetAButton()` and `GetAButtonPressed()` methods of https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_xbox_controller.html[`frc::XboxController`]?
. How would you implement the P-controller logic with only one call to the `Set()` method of the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_spark.html[`frc::Spark`] class?
|===

=== Sending Data with Shuffleboard

Not only is possible to send data from the robot program to Shuffleboard but also to send data back to the robot. The changing of the K~p~ constant in the above situation is a perfect example of when using Shuffleboard to send data to the robot is helpful.  If we can send the K~p~ value to the robot while it is running then we do not need to change the code / compile / deploy just to change one constant.  Above we used the `PutNumber()` method of the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_smart_dashboard.html[`frc::SmartDashboard`] class to send a number to Shuffleboard.  There is a corresponding `GetNumber()` method that will read a number from Shuffleboard. If we create a Shuffleboard entry in `RobotInit()` for the K~p~ value then we can read that value in `TeleopPeriodic()`.  This way the value can be changed in Shuffleboard and it will use the new value in `TeleopPeriodic()`.

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Change the code so that the value of the *K~p~* constant is read from Shuffleboard and therefore can be set while the robot code is running.
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. When we find a good value for K~p~ what should we do to remember it?
. It is dangerous to allow critical constants to be changed while in `TeleOperated` mode during a competition.  `Test` mode is used to change parameters like this.  How would `Test` mode be used so the K~p~ parameter cannot be changed during `TeleOperated` mode?
|===

=== Shuffleboard Graphs

Read the https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/shuffleboard/index.html[Shuffleboard^] documentation and in particular https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/shuffleboard/getting-started/shuffleboard-graphs.html[Working with Graphs].

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Graph the desired position (setpoint) and the actual encoder position in a `Shuffleboard` graph.
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. What is the shape of the curve as you move from the 0 position to the 500 position and back?
. Does the actual position get exactly to the desired position?
|===

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Modify the units returned by the encoder as demonstrated in <<encoder-values>> to use rotations.  Have Button *A* still go to 0 but change Button *B* to go to 2 rotations.
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. How does the change in units affect the value of the *K~p~* constant?
|===

=== Relative Encoder Limitations

Relative encoders consider the "0" position to be wherever the motor was when the encoder was powered on.  Therefore it is not possible to know where the "0" position is and it changes each time the robot is powered on.

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Note where the encoder considers the zero positon.  Disable the robot and manually move the position motor to a new position then restart the robot code by going to `Diagnostics -> Restart Robot Code` in the Driver Station.  Re-enable the robot and notice that the 0 position is not in the same location as the last time the code was run.
|===

// === Limit Switch

// A limit switch can be used to put a motor with a relative encoder into a known location.  This is commonly done on CNC mills and routers that use stepper motors.  Currently the Test Bench does not have a limit switch to use.

=== Absolute Encoder

So far we have been using the relative quadrature output of the {hw-srxmag}.  The encoder also has a PWM signal for absolute positioning (See https://store.ctr-electronics.com/content/user-manual/Magnetic%20Encoder%20User%27s%20Guide.pdf[SRX Mag Encoder Hardware Guide]). The https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_duty_cycle_encoder.html[`frc::DutyCycleEncoder`] class is used to interface with the PWM absolute position signal which is wired to the DIO channel {pos-motor-abs}.

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Modify the code to read the {hw-srxmag}'s absolute PWM signal using the `GetAbsolutePosition()` method of the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_duty_cycle_encoder.html[`frc::DutyCycleEncoder`] class.  Move the motor disc by hand and note the values returned by the encoder.  Use the absolute PWM signal to always move to the same 0 position when the *A* Button is pressed on the controller. 
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. What is the maximum value that the encoder reads and what happens when you rotate more than one rotation?
. What is the difference between the `GetAbsolutePosition()` and `GetDistance()` methods of the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_duty_cycle_encoder.html[`frc::DutyCycleEncoder`] class?
|===

=== Physical Units

The absolute encoder PWM signal is reading in "counts" just like the relative encoder signal did in <<encoder-values>>.  In this case the absolute signal has a larger number of "counts" per rotation that the relative signal.  As before, it is much more useful to use some physical units with the encoder.

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Modify the code to move to locations based on angles in degrees when the *A* and *B* Buttons are pressed.  You will need to determine how to configure the  https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_duty_cycle_encoder.html[`frc::DutyCycleEncoder`] class to return angles in degrees.  It is different than `frc::Encoder`.
|===

== Velocity Control Exercise
:tasknum: 0

Velocity control is typically used on flywheels for shooting mechanisms or sometimes for intake wheels for game pieces.  Using velocity control may seem like essentially the same as setting a motor's percent output. However, velocity control reads the speed that the motor is actually spinning and makes corrections if the speed is wrong whereas percent output does not check for the correct speed. This becomes important, for example, when the battery voltage drops while the robot is running during a competition which will cause a motor set to a percent output value to slow down.

There is a very good description of controling a flywheel mechanism in the link below along with some interactive tools to see how changing the control system parameters affects the flywheel behavior.

TIP: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/tuning-flywheel.html[Tuning a Flywheel Controller]

=== REVLib

We will use the velocity motor ({hw-neo550}) that is connected to the {hw-sparkmax} motor controller for this exercise.  The {hw-sparkmax} uses the CAN bus of the {hw-roboRIO} and requires an external (vendor) library to function. https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/3rd-party-libraries.html#vs-code[Vendor libraries can be added to a project following these instructions].  You need to add the "RevLIB 2023" library to this project in order to use the {hw-sparkmax} controller.

The https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/cpp/classrev_1_1_c_a_n_spark_max.html[rev::CANSparkMax] class is used to communicate with the {hw-sparkmax} controller.  The https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/cpp/classrev_1_1_c_a_n_spark_max.html[rev::CANSparkMax] is not part of the WPILib library and was added when the REVLib vendor library was added to the project in the steps above.  Therefore the documention for the https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/cpp/classrev_1_1_c_a_n_spark_max.html[rev::CANSparkMax] class and other classes that are provided by the REVLib library are located on the RevRobotics website.  The xref:README.adoc#resources[Resources] section of the Coding Guide gives links to the RevLib documentation, RevLib {CPP} API, and RevLib Examples. The xref:README.adoc#resources[Resources] section also has several other useful links.

=== Velocity P-Control

NOTE: Read the xref:README.adoc#motion-control[Motion Control] section (again).  

The {hw-sparkmax} is assigned CAN id #{spark-max-CANid} on the CAN bus. In `Robot.h`, create a variable for the motor using the https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/cpp/classrev_1_1_c_a_n_spark_max.html[rev::CANSparkMax] class.  You will need to determine what header file is needed to use the class.  The https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/cpp/classrev_1_1_c_a_n_spark_max.html[rev::CANSparkMax] `Set()` method will be used to control the motor percent output.  Use the https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/cpp/classrev_1_1_c_a_n_spark_max.html[rev::CANSparkMax] `GetEncoder()` method to access the built-in encoder on the {hw-neo550}. The `GetEncoder()` method returns a https://codedocs.revrobotics.com/cpp/classrev_1_1_spark_max_relative_encoder.html[rev::SparkMaxRelativeEncoder] class object that can be used to retrieve the motor velocity (what method?).

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Write a program to spin the {hw-neo550} to 9000 RPM when the *A Button* is held down.  Use P-control on the motor velocity. Graph the setpoint and actual velocity in Shuffleboard.
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. What value of K~p~ should you start with as a best guess?
. Does the motor reach the setpoint velocity?
. What is happening in this case (as opposed to position control)?
|===

=== Feed Forward

TIP: See https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/introduction-to-feedforward.html[Introduction to DC Motor Feedforward] and https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/controllers/feedforward.html[Feedforward Control in WPILib]

NOTE: Read the xref:README.adoc#feed-forward[Feed Forward] section and, if confused, read the xref:README.adoc#motion-control[Motion Control] section a third time and the above WPILib information. This topic is confusing at first and you may need to re-read these sections several times.

Feed forward predictions are typically expressed in units of voltage.  P-control on the otherhand is usually giving you a corrective error in percentage units.  When using feed forward it is most common to use the motor controller class' `SetVoltage()` method if one exists.

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Modify your program to spin the {hw-neo550} to 9000 RPM when the *A Button* is held down using velocity based feed forward only.
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. How do you determine the value of K~v~ you should start with? (HINT: See xref:README.adoc#motors[Motors Section] and pay attention to units!)
. Can you get the motor reach the setpoint velocity?  What about a different setpoint velocity?
|===

=== Feed Forward with P-control

Typically a motorized mechanism would be controlled with both some form of feed forward combined with PID feedback to compensate for any error.  The PID values (-1 to 1) are usually scaled to voltage (multiply by 12) and then the two terms (FF and PID) are added and sent to the `SetVoltage()` method.  

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Modify your program to use both feed forward and P-control.
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. What would work if a class didn't have a `SetVoltage()` method?
|===


=== Built-in WPILib Classes for Control

== Trapezoidal Motion Exercise
:tasknum: 0

In <<position-control-exercise>> if the current motor position was very far from the desired position, then the motor would be immediately set to full power (100% output) toward the new desired position.  This results in very abrupt and jerky movements of the mechanism.  A better way to move the motor is to smoothly accelerate the motor towards the *goal* position until we reach a "cruise" velocity and then as we get close to the *goal* position we smoothly decelerate to a stop.  This type of motion is called a trapezoidal motion profile because the plot of the velocity during the motion is a trapezoid.

The term *goal* is emphasized because it differs from the setpoint that we have been using up until this point.  The way profiled motion works is that at each timestep the trapezoid profile computes a new setpoint.  The setpoint has both position information and velocity information.  The profiled motion is finished when the setpoint reaches the *goal*.  Because the setpoint has position and velocity information, it is fairly straight forward to use feed forward and PID control while performing a profiled motion.

The WPILib provides the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_trapezoid_profile.html[`frc::TrapezoidProfile<Distance>`] class to generate a trapezoidal motion profile.  It is a template class templated on either an angular unit or a distance unit.  The WPI Documenation describes https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/controllers/trapezoidal-profiles.html[using trapezoidal motion profiles]. 

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Write a program to use a trapezoidal profile to move the position motor disc to a 0 degree position when *Button A* is pressed and 180 degrees when *Button B* is pressed. Use P-control, then add feed forward once P-control works.
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. How does the maximum acceleration and maximum velocity affect the speed and accuracy of the motion?

== Arm Control Exercise
:tasknum: 0

A vertical arm mechanism is one of the most complex control problems that is encountered on FRC robots. The links below give the basic information needed to understand the feed forward and PID aspects of the problem.  Moving a vertical arm with motion profiles (i.e. trapezoidal profiles) gives good results and allows easy feed forward compensation. 

TIP: See https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/introduction-to-feedforward.html#arm-feedforward[Arm Feedforward] and https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/advanced-controls/introduction/tuning-vertical-arm.html[Tuning a Vertical Arm Position Controller]

|===
a| `*TASK {counter:tasknum}*`
| Write a program to use a trapezoidal profile to move the position motor disc with the added weight blocks to a 0 degree position when *Button A* is pressed, 90 degrees when *Button B* is pressed, and 180 degrees when *Button Y* is pressed. Use both feed forward and PID control. 
a| QUESTIONS: ::
. How can K~v~ be fine tuned using graphs?
. What is the feed forward output at each position?
