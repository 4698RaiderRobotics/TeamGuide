== Test Bench Description

The Test Bench was created to allow students wanting to learn FRC robot programming a way to do example problems without needing access to a functioning robot.  As you read these examples they will refer to terms and/or concepts that will not be familiar to you.  Stop and lookup what these unfamiliar terms/concepts mean as you go along.  

The test bench uses a https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/roborio-info/roborio-introduction.html[RoboRIO 1] and a https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#ctre-power-distribution-panel[CTRE Power Distribution Panel].  It has two simple brushed motors (a https://www.andymark.com/products/neverest-classic-40-gearmotor[NeveRest with 40:1 gearbox] and a unknown motor) connected to two different motor controllers (a https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#spark-motor-controller[SPARK] and a https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#victor-sp[Victor SP]).  Both motor controllers are controlled with PWM. The "Position Control" motor is the NeveRest motor that is connected to a large disc.  The "Velocity Control" motor is the other small generic motor.

The "Velocity Control" motor is connected to the https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#victor-sp[Victor SP] motor controller which is wired into the roboRIO PWM channel 0.  It has a https://store.ctr-electronics.com/srx-mag-encoder/[SRX Mag Encoder] attached to its output shaft.  The SRX is wired into the roboRIO DIO channels 0, 1, and 2.  Channels 0 & 1 are the Quadrature A and B inputs and channel 2 is the absolute PWM signal.

The "Position Control" motor is connected to the https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#spark-motor-controller[SPARK] motor controller which is wired into the roboRIO PWM channel 1.  It also has a https://store.ctr-electronics.com/srx-mag-encoder/[SRX Mag Encoder] attached to its output shaft.  The SRX is wired into the roboRIO DIO channels 3, 4, and 5. Channels 3 & 4 are the Quadrature A and B inputs and channel 5 is the absolute PWM signal.

The Test Bench does not have a WiFi radio so the coding computer must be connected to the roboRIO with a USB cable (USB A to USB B).  The Test Bench must also be powered by a robot battery.

== Percent Output Example

In this example we will be creating a "Timed Robot" program to set the velocity motor's percent output based on the position of a joystick.

Launch "WPILib VS Code" from the desktop.  This runs VS Code with the WPILib libraries and tools enabled. https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vscode-overview/creating-robot-program.html[Follow these directions to create a blank project from the "Timed Skeleton (Advanced)" template].

You should now have an empty project.  The two files that we will be working with are `src/main/include/Robot.h` and `src/main/cpp/Robot.cpp`.  Find those files in the Explorer on the left sidebar of VS Code and open `Robot.h`.  It contains the `Robot` class which declares (See https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/forward-declarations/[Forward Declarations and Definitions]) the `Robot-`, `Autonomous-`, `Teleop-`, `Disabled-`, `Test-`, and `Simulation-` Init() and Periodic() functions.

#include <frc/TimedRobot.h>

class Robot : public frc::TimedRobot {
 public:
  void RobotInit() override;
  void RobotPeriodic() override;

  void AutonomousInit() override;
  void AutonomousPeriodic() override;

  void TeleopInit() override;
  void TeleopPeriodic() override;

  void DisabledInit() override;
  void DisabledPeriodic() override;

  void TestInit() override;
  void TestPeriodic() override;

  void SimulationInit() override;
  void SimulationPeriodic() override;
};
----

For this simple example we won't need most of the Init() and Periodic() functions so delete all the declared functions except `RobotInit()` and `TeleopPeriodic()`.  `RobotInit()` runs once when the code first starts and `TeleopPeriodic()` runs every 20 milliseconds while the  Driver Station is in Teleop Mode.

We need to add member variables to the `Robot` class for our motor controller and for a joystick.  The motor controller on the velocity motor is a https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/controls-overviews/control-system-hardware.html#victor-sp[Victor SP] controller so we will be using the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_victor_s_p.html[`frc::VictorSP`] class.  Open the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_victor_s_p.html[`frc::VictorSP` class API documentation] which will show what methods are available with the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_victor_s_p.html[`frc::VictorSP`] class and what header needs to be included to use the class.  In the API documentation for https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_victor_s_p.html[`frc::VictorSP`] only the constructor that takes the PWM channel is shown along with the default constructor and the assignment operator.  Expand the `Public Member Functions inherited from frc::PWMMotorController` section to see more member functions that are available that are inherited from the `frc::PWMMotorController` class which is a base class of `frc::VictorSP` (See xref:CPP_Lessons.adoc#object-orientation[Object Orientation]).  In `Robot.h` add a private section to the `Robot` class that declares a `frc::VictorSP` variable and initialized the channel to zero. Also add a https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_joystick.html[`frc::Joystick`] variable initialized to port zero. Add the two headers that are needed for the new classes.

The `src/main/cpp/Robot.cpp` file has the definitions of the Init() and Periodic() functions for the `Robot` class. Remove all the Init() and Periodic() functions except `RobotInit()` and `TeleopPeriodic()`.  Now add the line shown below to `TeleopPeriodic()` which sets the motor percent output (-1 to 1 value) to the value of the X-axis on the joystick.

#include "Robot.h"

void Robot::RobotInit() {}

void Robot::TeleopPeriodic() {
  m_motor.Set( m_joystick.GetX() );
}

#ifndef RUNNING_FRC_TESTS
int main() {
  return frc::StartRobot<Robot>();
}
#endif

Compile the project and make sure there are no errors.  Then connect to the test bench with a USB cable and power the test bench. Connect a joystick to the coding laptop and run the Driver Station.  Now deploy the code to the roboRIO.  Select `Teleop` on the driver station and press `Enable`.  The joystick should control the speed of the motor.

=== Visualizing What is Happening

The `Shuffleboard` program is used to communicate with the roboRIO.  The roboRIO can send information to `Shuffleboard` and `Shuffleboard` can be used to send information to the roboRIO.  The https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_smart_dashboard.html[`frc::SmartDashboard`] class is one method to communicate with `Shuffleboard`.  We will use the *static* member functions of the https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_smart_dashboard.html[`frc::SmartDashboard`] class to add information about the motor and the joystick position to `Shuffleboard`. 

[%collaspable]
****
*{CPP}* classes with *static* member functions are used like regular functions. You do not create instances of the class. See https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/static-member-functions/[Static Member Functions]
****

Modify `Robot.cpp` to the following:

[source,C++]
----
#include "Robot.h"
#include <frc/smartdashboard/SmartDashboard.h>

void Robot::RobotInit() {
  frc::SmartDashboard::PutData( "Velocity Motor", &m_motor );
}

void Robot::TeleopPeriodic() {
  double x_axis = m_joystick.GetX();

  frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber( "X-axis", x_axis );
  m_motor.Set( x_axis );
}

#ifndef RUNNING_FRC_TESTS
int main() {
  return frc::StartRobot<Robot>();
}
#endif
----

Compile and deploy the code to the test bench.  Run shuffleboard and select the "SmartDashboard" tab.  Select `Teleop` in the Driver Station and `Enable` the roboRIO.
